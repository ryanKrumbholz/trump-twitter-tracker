# trump-twitter-tracker

Description: A twitter bot that counts the number of times Trump has tweeted in one day, including retweets. I just made this for fun and to learn a little bit about tweepy and twitter's api.

Feel free to download and play with the bot yourself!

To get it working you will need to get the developer keys from the twitter developer page and change the code appropriately.

Working version can be found here: https://twitter.com/trumptrackernow
